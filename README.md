# Introduction

This document is a description of a java project called Gomoku. 

> [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is an abstract strategy board game. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this document, I will explain my code line by line. The purpose of doing so is to summarize all the technics that I have learned from this project and leave a record for future reference. I hope this document could also help other developers to finish their project.
